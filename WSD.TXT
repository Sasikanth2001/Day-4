Certainly! In JavaScript, window, screen, and document are objects that are part of the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). They serve different purposes and provide access to various properties and methods. Here's a brief overview of the differences between them:

window Object:

The window object represents the browser window or a frame.
It is the global object in a browser's JavaScript environment, meaning that variables and functions declared globally become properties and methods of the window object.
It provides properties like document, location, navigator, and methods like alert(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().
Example:
       window.alert("Hello, World!");

screen Object:

The screen object provides information about the user's screen, such as width, height, color depth, and pixel depth.
It allows you to retrieve information about the user's display.
Example:       
       console.log(screen.width);
       console.log(screen.height);

document Object:

The document object represents the entire HTML document.
It provides access to the content of the document and allows you to manipulate the HTML structure, elements, and their styles.
Commonly used properties include getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), and methods like createElement().
Example: 
       let heading = document.getElementById("myHeading");
       heading.textContent = "New Heading";   

In summary:

window is the global object and represents the browser window or frame.
screen provides information about the user's screen.
document represents the HTML document and provides methods to interact with the document's content.
